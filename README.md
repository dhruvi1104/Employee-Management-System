# Employee-Management-System
Spring | Maven
By using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf, you can build an employee management system for an organization. But for this, you should be familiar with the basic concepts of both of these technologies. The user of your EMS solution should be able to add an employee, view all employees, delete any employee, sort the data, and paginate. 

It is a rather complex project that might take you some time to complete. However, once you’re done, you’d be familiar with the Thymeleaf CRUD, Spring Boot, and their various functionalities in handling databases. 

You’ll have to use an IDE, Spring Data JPA, Spring Boot 2.2, Maven 3.2+, and Spring Framework 5.2. You should divide it into steps and complete them one-by-one. Start with setting up the database, and then start adding the required features.
